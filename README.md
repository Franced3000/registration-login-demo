# Registration Login Demo
### we will use the latest version of all the tools and technologies:
- Spring Boot 3
- Spring MVC 6
- Spring Security 6
- Hibernate 6
- Thymeleaf 3
- MySQL 8
- Maven

We validate the user registration fields with Java bean validation annotations and Hibernate validator implementation.
 
Basically, we will develop a simple User Registration Module using Role-based Spring Security that can be used in any Spring MVC-based project.
